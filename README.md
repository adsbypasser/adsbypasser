## Supported Sites

See [SITES.md](SITES.md)


## Run-time Configurations

Please see [this page][10] to adjust configurations.

* Align to center (default: on)

    Image will align to the center of screen.
    If you turn it off, **AdsBypasser** will not adjust that for you.

* Change background (default: on)

    Image page will have a dark background, just like the theme used in
    Mozilla Firefox.
    If you turn it off, **AdsBypasser** will not adjust that for you.

* Scale image (default: on)

    Image will scale to fit your screen size.
    You can still toggle the image size by clicking on the image.
    If you turn this off, **AdsBypasser** will not adjust that for you.

* Redirect image (default: on)

    **AdsBypasser** will directly open the image by browser if the
    current site is an image hosting site.
    If you turn this off, **AdsBypasser** will only work on sites that shorten links.

* External server support (default: off)

    **AdsBypasser** will send requests to an external server, because browser-side
    JavaScript can not solve some problems (e.g.: captcha).
    This is not enabled by default because of privacy concern.


## How To Build

Please install [Node.js] and [npm], then run:

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install
grunt
```

Combined userscript will be `dest/adsbypasser.user.js`, which could install on
browser.
